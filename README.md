## Frontend Overview

Center Stage makes heavy use of React and Redux. The react to display logic is handled by the React Libraries. The Redux is used to handle all state management,
with api calls to the backend server to retrieve data.

## Backend Overview

* <h1>Backend Technologies Used</h1>

Center Stage's backend server runs with Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and Faker. Express was used as an easier and more simple flow of data from the backend to the front end, 
as JavaScript being the language used in both. PostgreSQL was the database of choice because it is more familiar than any other database. With Sequelize's seemless integration with 
PostgresSql made it the easy choice for Center Stage's ORM. And Finally, Faker was used to create fake data to populate the app as we wait for more users.
